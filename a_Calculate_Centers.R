# Calculate POI Centers for all US and Territories Lakes -------------

# This {targets} list calculates "Point of Inaccessibility", also known as Cheybyshev 
# Center for all lakes/reservoirs/impoundments greater than 1ha in surface area 
# using the NHDPlus polygons using the {nhdplusTools} package and the `poi()` 
# function in the {polylabelr} package. At some point, this workflow will need
# to be updated to the new USGS 3DHP data, but that isn't complete right now. 
# Additionally, we are intentionally using NHDPlusV2 instead of NHDPlusHR because
# of computational time within the scope of this workflow. For HUC4s that are not
# included in the NHDPlusV2, we access the NHD Best Resolution product directly
# from the NHD from the National Map url.
